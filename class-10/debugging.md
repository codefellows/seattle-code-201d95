# Debugging

The ideal: prevent bugs all together

How do we prevent bugs?

- breaking down our problems into small steps
- write our code in small steps
- look for proof of life at each step
- variable tracking
- rely on our tools - ex. rainbow brackets in VS code (extension), syntax highlighting
- plan out code, scafold it out, add comments, make a plan in advance

How do we debug when we do have bugs?

- indentify the problem
- dev tools (is there an error message?)
- second set of eyes
- read your code line by line as if you are the computer - add comments at each step
- take a break, fresh eyes
- ask for help!!! 15 minute rule
- comment out all your code and then comment it in line by line

I know where the bug is now what?

- is the data type what I expect
- what variables/functions/methods are only available where?
- googling the error message - Stack overflow!!!
- google the syntax - READ THE DOCS!
